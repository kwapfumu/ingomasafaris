It is the second largest lake in depth after Lake Baikal in Russia. About 800 km long and 50 km wide, in some places it reaches depths of 1,435 meters. With 18,800 km3, this lake is the largest reservoir of fresh water in Africa. It drains a catchment area of about 220,000 km2. It is fed by many tributaries; the most important are the Rusizi (which drains Lake Kivu) and Malagarazi which drains the western Tanzania. Its outlet is the Lukuga River.</p>
                                                                <p>This ecosystem contains a remarkable fauna. In most species of cichlid fish (over 250 species), it houses collections of other non-cichlid species (over 145 species) and invertebrates over 60 species of gastropods, more than 15 species of bivalves, plus 69 copepod species, over 20 species of lick, 84 ostracods, 15 species of decapods and  over 9 species of sponges.</p>
                                                                <p>If closely related species of cichlids from Lake Tanganyika are known worldwide, three non-cichlid species are of particular interest: two species of Clupeidae (sardines) and Latesstappersi dominate biomass and are the target of industrial and artisanal fishing lake. With more than 1,300 species of vertebrates and invertebrates, this lake is one of the world's richest freshwater ecosystems. Of these, 500 are endemic to.</p>
                                                                <p>Also, Lake Tanganyika has been for a long time a way of sizeable market for the riparian countries. Indeed, in the mid 19th century, products (cotton, son of brass beads) from the Indian Ocean passed by the lakeside path. And since then, it still plays an important role in the economy.</p>
                                                                <p>Initiatives are taken to safeguard it by the riparian countries, including: a Strategic Action Plan for the Sustainable Management of Lake Tanganyika and subregional Convention on the Protection of Lake Tanganyika ratified by Burundi on 22 July 2004.</p>
                                                                <p>Despite threats (factors of erosion, pollution, sedimentation and fishing techniques) facing Lake Tanganyika, it retains its integrity because of its natural appearance characterized by an extremely rich and complex biodiversity, with more than 1500 species plants and animals almost half of which are endemic.</p>
                                                                <p>Lake Tanganyika is part of the Western Rift Valley lakes of East Africa. This lake is known for its natural appearance characterized by an extremely rich and complex biodiversity: 4500 species of plants and animals which nearly half are endemic to the ecosystem, a vital water source for local residents of the lake.</p>

As for all protected areas, national park Kibira was institutionalized by Decree-Law No. 1/6 from 03 March 1980. It extends south to Bugarama the border with Rwanda to the north over a distance of roughly 80 km and an average width of 8 km. Its area is about 40,000 ha.</p>
                                                                    <p>He then joined the Nyungwe Forest in neighboring Rwanda. It spreads on Muramvya, Kayanza, Cibitoke and Bubanza at an altitude between 1600 and 2600 m. The National Park is a Kibira African montane forest composed of three remaining forested areas and a diverse ecosystem.</p>
                                                                    <p>On an altitude between 1100 and 1600 m, there is a clear forest (Albizia Entadaabyssinica, Proteamandinsis) while on the tops of ridges Mumirwa and high hills Mugamba a rainforest mountains and galleries observed submontane . On the eastern slope of the ridge, the forest is partially up the bamboo-dominated Arundinariaalpina. Along the ridge are the remains of Afromontane forest dominated by Prunus africana, Entandrophragmaexcelsum, etc. Parinariexcelca. The top of the ridge is covered by xerophytic vegetation Philipiaerica, Vaccinium, and Agauria Struthiola. It is a forest composed of several stages related to altitude.</p>

This plays an important role in the basins of the Nile and Congo rivers to the Mediterranean and the Atlantic Ocean. It has a notable influence on the hydrological regulation and protection against soil erosion.</p>

Registered in the publication of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) since 1996, it meets the criteria for classification as national parks all protected areas in the country. All hunting, fishing, gathering and mining is prohibited there, tourism is regulated with a layout of a circuit. Under these conditions, the National Park Kibira keeps its original features. The only disturbances observed during the crisis of 1993 were related to logging, the clearing, forest fires and mining and quarrying.</p>
                                                                    <p>Another feature of the conservation of the national park is Kibira association managers and the local population in a fashion awareness of sustainable use of forest resources.</p>

The Royal Geographical Society has funded several expeditions from Zanzibar. In 1858, after 6 months of exploration, Richard Burton and John Speke discovered Lake Tanganyika. Speke later discovered another even bigger lake he named Lake Victoria in honor of the Queen of England and thought and have found the source of the Nile.</p>

The waters from Ethiopia arrived in Khartoum by the Blue Nile. In this city, the Nile is constituted by a single river and through Sudan and Egypt before emptying into the Mediterranean Sea. This river has the attention of the international community through projects Nile Basin Initiative (NBI) Basin.</p>

They were more concentrated in the region Muramvya. At the end of each year, the royal court organized the festival of planting sorghum (umuganuro) attended, among others, the ritualistic Gishora.</p>

It is located on the top of the hill in the town of Gishora Giheta 7 km from the town of Gitega.</p>

The case is an example Gishora. Indeed, royaleest residence consists of three unequal classes. In the residence of Gishora the premièrecour or forecourt, called intangaro, the shrine of the sacred drums. The second largest of which is the royal court, including the royal residence (ingoro). At the time, the court was usually occupied by the chefs and backyard (ikigo) includes accommodation servants, box of worship (indaroyaRugabo) and attics. This court was only reserved for the royal family. Before entering the residence, there was a public place called home inama. This place served as a first waiting for all those who came to the court.</p> 
                                                                                        <p>The uniqueness of the royal residence (ingoro) is characterized by its technical construction. The circumference of the residence is traced through two units related measures called itambwe (a unit of measurement equal to one lay face down on the floor and arms raised man). Then plant a number of piles and poles (poles Markhamialutea, Spathodeanilotica). We dig, every 30 to 40 cm, holes 50-60 cm deep to receive 45-60 vertical piles 2 m high, between which plant 120 to 200 long poles (about 4 m) that will support the roof. Once the stakes and poles are placed, they are bound by a first horizontal doubled torus encircling the building. This core is composed of a core of papyrus reeds sheathed finely woven.</p>
                                                                                        <p>At the same time, another team manufactures the inner part inside the roof construction. This underlay is the most original part of the royal house. The vaulting braid as a backplane reversed using a reed papyrus. This cap is centered on a pole height of a man is gradually added to it by following three concentric hoops manufactured outside assembled every 20 or 30 cm. The whole is raised progressively to its enlargement split poles by becoming longer and consolidated by radial rods. When the dome is approximately the diameter of the case, it is definitely drawn to the desired height using 13 pillars ending in hooves ridge pegged finely decorated by pyrography. While the lower part is firmly connected to the top of the posts at the main torus.</p>
                                                                                        <p>It is only then that folds the outer poles of the dome to link them to a height of 3.40 m, determining the curved frame of the royal house. The cover is made with care by specialists. They first conducted a band of 3 to 4 cm thick sheaves related every 30 to 40 cm core base. Then they cover all the thatch from the top without the tie, throwing five cords.</p> 
                                                                                        <p>The last step is to plant the nerve (igisenge), braided with papyrus and secured by a pin of wood on top of the house. It builds thereafter the doorway and awning. Jamb, consisting of four uprights Bamboo meter driven into the ground and surrounded by a bundle of fine art by bamboo tied with cords of papyrus supports an arched lintel of the same design.</p>
                                                                                        <p>The thick straw canopy, finely combed and smoothed to pruning, a direct descendant of the dome and extends slightly on both doors very low (80 cm) (main entrance and the opposite for the rear yard) contributing to the thermal protection.

It allowed the king to observe everything that was happening in the room.</p>

It houses two sacred drums (Ruciteme and Murimirwa) lying on a bench and facing the entrance and the other drums placed vertically on the floor. The Batimbo, ritualistic region and bearers of this heritage, the drums brought to the royal court on the occasion of the celebration of the annual festival of sowing (umuganuro).</p>

Indeed, its supporting structure consists of a small woven basket vault (papyrus) is surrounded by a thin spiral hoop (seven to eight turns) whose core is sheathed palm papyrus cords. Also, five double concentric hoops or triple liaise with the arch of the roof frame which is also a cluster of palms, but where the cladding is replaced by simple ligation of papyrus. The thatching is dressed in a sort of dry papyrus mat woven with strings of the same plant. There is only one door.</p>

                                                                                        <p>Le tambour est une partie importante de l'héritage culturel burundais. Le célèbre Royal-Tambours du Burundi, qui s'est produit plus de quarante ans à travers le monde entier, est connu pour ses tambours traditionnels comme les Amashāko, les Ibishikiso, l'Inkiránya et Kirotsa, le petit tambour. La troupe se produit toujours, sur l'ancien site royal de Gishōra, situé à quelques kilomètres (10 km précisément)au nord de Gitéga, la seconde ville en importance au Burundi. La danse accompagne souvent les performances du tambour, musique populaire des célébrations et réunions de famille. Les Abatīmbo, dont on joue lors des cérémonies officielles et des rituels, et le rythme rapide de l'Abanyagasīmbo sont de célèbres danses burundaises. À noter également l'Umwĭrōnge(la flûte), l'Ikēmbe, l'Indonōngo, l'Umudúri, l'Inānga (la cithare)etc… La réputation des tambourinaires a dépassé les limites du Burundi pour devenir internationale. En Afrique, ils symbolisent même la bonne orchestration du tambour.

                                                                                            Leur art est sacr&eacute. Il est aussi profane. C'est un lien mystique entre un pays, un peuple et un instrument. « Ingoma », c'est à la fois le tambour, le départ (" Inkóko ni yó ngoma" : On part au chant du coq), le royaume et l'époque.

                                                                                            Les tambourinaires joue aussi lors des fetes,Ils entrent en scène leur tambour sur la tête. Ils chantent en même temps qu'ils dansent. Disposés en arc de cercle autour du tambour central, l'Inkiránya, ils attendent son signal. Alors, groupés en deux groupes, les AbanyaMashāko et les AbanyaBishikizo battent leur rythme dans une harmonie surprenante. Le Tambourinaire soliste, celui qui bat l'Inkiránya ou le tambour central, exécute une danse où se mêlent fantaisie et gravité. Danse guerrière, sa gestuelle est significative. Le soliste par moments mime le geste de se trancher la gorge. Cela traduit son attachement à son pays : « Que je meure si je trahis le Tambour! » Tous les Ritualistes Batimbo le suivent, parce qu'il est considéré comme leur roi et eux ses sujets.

                                                                                            Les tambourinaires ou le Ritualistes Batimbo du Burundi manient aussi l'humour, la satire et l'élégance. Le danseur soliste se transforme en un gentil clown marchant sur les mains, empruntant une démarche caricaturale et faisant des clins d'oeil au public. Les Tambourinaires ou les Ritualistes Batimbo du Burundi occupent Ikiránya ou jouent pour le public à tour de rôle. Ils peuvent jouer seul, à deux, à tois voire à quatre. Ils sont en quelque sorte de véritables athètes qui courent, sautent, se tordent le cou et/ou les hanches, font des enjambements, etc. En ce moment, les Tambourinaires qui sont battent les Tambours sautent, chantent, marchent autour des Tambours qu'ils battent tout en suivant la cadence qu'exige la danse de l'artiste qui danse devant eux, leur roi. Aun fond, il s'appelle le roi, car, outre que ses sujets battent les Tambours en repondant à l'invitation du roi, celui-ci peut arrêter la danse s'il est certain que c'est ce qui est nécessaire de faire. </p>
